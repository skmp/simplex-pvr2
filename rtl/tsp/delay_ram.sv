//
// delay_ram - a fixed-latency delay line ("shift register") backed by an M10K
// block RAM instead of a chain of registers. Presents the SAME timing as a
// DELAY-deep register shift register: data written when `en` is high appears at
// `dout` exactly DELAY enabled clocks later. Frozen when `en` is low (global
// pipeline stall), so it composes with a clock-enabled pipeline.
//
// Why RAM instead of flops: for wide payloads carried through a multi-cycle
// alignment delay (e.g. the fp_rcp_fast latency realignment in tsp_shade_pp,
// which delays 960+ bits by 3), a register chain costs DELAY*WIDTH flops in ALM
// fabric. A single simple-dual-port M10K holds the same data in block RAM and
// frees the fabric.
//
// Implementation: a circular buffer. A write pointer advances each enabled clock
// and stores `din`; the read address trails it by DELAY. The M10K read is itself
// registered (1 cycle), so to land dout on the DELAY-th enabled clock we present
// read address (wptr - (DELAY-1)) combinationally and let the RAM's own read
// register supply the final cycle. Read-during-write to the same word cannot
// occur here because DELAY>=1 keeps read and write addresses distinct.
//
// CAVEAT ON DEPTH: block RAM is only a win when DELAY is deep enough to amortize
// the addressing overhead and when Quartus actually infers an M10K. Very shallow
// delays (DELAY<=2) are better left as flops - the fitter may keep them in
// registers regardless of the ramstyle hint. This module is intended for the
// wide, DELAY>=3 alignment lines.
